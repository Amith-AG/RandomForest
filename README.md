# RandomForest
The provided code demonstrates the usage of the Random Forest algorithm for a classification task using the diabetes dataset. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. Each tree in the forest independently predicts the class, and the final prediction is determined by a majority vote or averaging the predictions.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. Import necessary libraries: The code begins by importing the required libraries. `pandas` is imported as `pd` for data manipulation, and `numpy` is imported as `np` for numerical computations. The diabetes dataset is loaded using `pd.read_csv` from the 'diabetes.csv' file.

2. Split the data into training and test sets: The code uses `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection` to split the data into training and test sets. It takes the input features (`diabetes.loc[:, diabetes.columns != 'Outcome']`) and the target variable (`diabetes['Outcome']`). The `stratify` parameter ensures that the class distribution is preserved in the train-test split. The `random_state` parameter is set to 66 for reproducibility. The resulting splits are stored in `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test`.

3. Create an instance of Random Forest Classifier: The code creates an instance of the Random Forest Classifier using `RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)`. The `n_estimators` parameter specifies the number of decision trees to be included in the random forest, and `random_state` ensures reproducibility of the results.

4. Fit the Random Forest model: The `fit` method is used to train the Random Forest model. It takes the training data (`X_train` and `y_train`) as input and fits the model to the data.

5. Print accuracy on training and test sets: The code calculates and prints the accuracy of the Random Forest model on the training and test sets using `rf.score(X_train, y_train)` and `rf.score(X_test, y_test)`, respectively. The `score` method returns the mean accuracy on the given data and labels.

In summary, this code loads the diabetes dataset, splits it into training and test sets, creates an instance of the Random Forest Classifier, trains the model, and evaluates its accuracy on both the training and test sets. The Random Forest algorithm combines multiple decision trees to make accurate predictions for classification tasks.
